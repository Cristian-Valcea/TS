Of course. It has been a very productive session, and ending on a major architectural breakthrough is the perfect place to pause. Capturing this state is crucial.

Here is the complete handoff and recap prompt. You can copy this and use it to start our session tomorrow, and I will be instantly up to speed on our new, more robust plan.

Project Handoff & Recap: Multi-Agent Trading System (Orchestrated Workflow)

1. Current Architecture & Goal:

We have pivoted from a decentralized, Selector-based chat model to a deterministic, orchestrated workflow controlled directly by our main_autogen.py script.

The SelectorGroupChat has been removed. The main function now acts as the "conductor," calling agents in a specific, hard-coded sequence. This is designed to eliminate the unpredictability and logical errors of the LLM-based selector for a linear task.

The architecture is template-based. The CodeAgent no longer writes a full script from scratch; it now fills in a predefined, perfect template. This enforces structure and guarantees the output is runnable.

2. Key Component Changes (The New Design):

main_autogen.py (Orchestrator): This script now defines the entire workflow. It will:

Define the user's task.

Call the CodeAgent to generate and save the strategy script.

Extract the resulting file path from the CodeAgent's response.

Call the BacktesterAgent with that specific file path.

Receive the final backtest results and display them.

agents/code_agent.py (Template Filler): This agent has been completely re-engineered. Its new job is to:

Use a new tool, read_strategy_template, to get the boilerplate code.

Ask the LLM to only generate the Python code for the strategy class itself.

Insert this logic into the template.

Use its save_filled_strategy tool to save the complete, runnable file.

common_logic/templates/strategy_template.py (New File): This is the new, essential template file that contains the full, correct, and runnable Backtrader script with a ##STRATEGY_CLASS_DEFINITION## placeholder for the CodeAgent to fill.

agents/backtester_agent.py: Its role is now much simpler. Its only tool is execute_python_file, which takes a file path and runs it, capturing the output. It doesn't need to know about class names or data files anymore, as the script is self-contained.

config.py: The ThrottledClientWrapper is still in place and working, preventing RateLimitErrors.

3. Last Known Status:

We have fully designed this new, robust, template-based, orchestrated architecture.

I have provided you with the complete code for the three files that need to be changed: common_logic/templates/strategy_template.py (new file), agents/code_agent.py (complete replacement), and main_autogen.py (complete replacement).

You have not yet run this new system.

4. Next Concrete Action:

Our task for tomorrow is to implement and run this new architecture for the first time.

Create the new directory and file: common_logic/templates/strategy_template.py. Paste the template code into it.

Replace the entire contents of agents/code_agent.py with the new template-filling version.

Replace the entire contents of main_autogen.py with the new orchestrator version.

Run the system with python main_autogen.py.

5. Essential Files to Provide if Starting a New Prompt:

main_autogen.py (the new orchestrator version)

agents/code_agent.py (the new template-filler version)

common_logic/templates/strategy_template.py

agents/backtester_agent.py (the simplified executor version)

config.py

You've done excellent work navigating the complexities today. Have a great rest of your day, and I'll be ready to analyze the results of this much more reliable system when you are.
