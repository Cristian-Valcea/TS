Project Handoff & Recap: Orchestrated Multi-Agent Trading System (SUCCESS STATE)
1. Current Status: End-to-End Workflow Success
VICTORY: We have achieved a complete, end-to-end successful run of the entire multi-agent workflow.
PROVEN WORKFLOW: The system correctly executed the following sequence without critical errors:
The OrchestratorAgent initiated the task.
The DataProvisioningAgent successfully fetched and saved the market data.
The CodeAgent successfully generated a complete, high-quality Python script for the strategy.
The OrchestratorAgent successfully cleaned the LLM's output (removing markdown) and saved the script to a file.
The ReviewerAgent successfully used its pylint and bandit tools on the file and gave a "Code review passed" verdict.
The OrchestratorAgent correctly interpreted the "passed" review and proceeded.
The BacktesterAgent successfully used its tool (backtrader_runner.py) to execute the script.
The backtest ran to completion, and the OrchestratorAgent successfully received and parsed the final JSON results.
CONCLUSION: The "factory assembly line" architecture is stable, robust, and functional. All major bugs related to agent logic, tool use, file I/O, and LLM formatting have been solved.
2. Core Architecture:
The system is built around a deterministic, LLM-less OrchestratorAgent which acts as the factory foreman.
The CodeAgent's role has been refined to be a "full script generator" tasked by the orchestrator with highly specific, example-driven prompts.
The ReviewerAgent acts as a successful Quality Assurance gatekeeper using real software engineering tools.
Communication is file-based, and the backtrader_runner.py utility is the core execution engine for backtests.
3. My Immediate Next Steps (Your Refactoring):
My next action, before we add new features, is to perform some code maintenance. This includes:
Refactoring the code for clarity.
Improving the logging output and format.
Removing old, commented-out code blocks.
Crucially, the core functionality and the successful architecture described above will remain unchanged during this process.
4. Our Next Functional Milestone:
Once my refactoring is complete, our next major goal will be to integrate the BO_Agent (Bayesian Optimization Agent).
This will involve adding a new step to the OrchestratorAgent's workflow that, after a successful backtest, tasks the BO_Agent with optimizing the strategy's parameters (e.g., the fast and slow periods) to maximize a specific metric like the Sharpe ratio.
5. Your Task When I Return:
When I return and provide this prompt, your task is to confirm you understand this exact state of success and our plan to integrate the BO_Agent next. Be ready to help me design the BO_Agent, its tools, and the necessary upgrades to the OrchestratorAgent's workflow.
This prompt perfectly captures our victory, my immediate plans, and our shared strategic vision for the next step. I'll be ready for you when you get back. Good luck with the refactoring
