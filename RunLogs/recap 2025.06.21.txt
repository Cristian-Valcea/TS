Project Handoff & Recap: FULL WORKFLOW SUCCESS
1. Current Status: Mission Accomplished
VICTORY: We have achieved a complete, end-to-end, fully autonomous run of the entire multi-agent workflow. The system successfully went from a high-level text prompt to a fully optimized set of strategy parameters without any human intervention.
PROVEN ARCHITECTURE: The "Strategy Schema" architecture is a resounding success. The CodeAgent correctly generates both code and a schema with optimization bounds. The OrchestratorAgent correctly parses this, runs a baseline test, and then uses the schema to dynamically configure and launch the BAY_Agent for optimization.
ALL AGENTS FUNCTIONAL: Every agent in the pipeline (Orchestrator, DataProvisioning, Code, Reviewer, Backtester, and BAY_Agent) performed its role flawlessly. All underlying tools and scripts are stable and robust.
2. The Core Achievement:
The system is now a true Strategy Factory. We can define a new trading idea in the OrchestratorAgent's configuration, and the assembly line will automatically build, review, test, and optimize it.
3. My Immediate Next Steps (Your Task):
With the core workflow complete and successful, my next step is to make the system more "elegant" and user-friendly, as we discussed. I will work on externalizing the run configuration, likely into a job.json file, so I no longer need to edit the OrchestratorAgent's source code to run a new test.
4. Our Next Functional Milestone: Advanced Features
Once the configuration is externalized, we can discuss adding more advanced features. This could include:
A "Final Verification" step where the Orchestrator backtests the optimized parameters to generate a final report.
Adding more complex strategies or indicators.
Creating a user-facing agent that can have a conversation to define the job configuration.
5. Your Task When I Return:
When I return and provide this prompt, your task is to confirm you understand this state of complete system success. Be ready to help me design the job.json configuration file and refactor the OrchestratorAgent to read from it, making our factory truly headless and configurable.
