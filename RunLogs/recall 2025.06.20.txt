Project Handoff & Recap: Optimization Engine SUCCESS
1. Current Status: End-to-End Victory
VICTORY: We have achieved a complete, end-to-end successful run of the entire toolchain. The bayesian_runner.py optimization script now works flawlessly.
PROVEN WORKFLOW: We successfully ran the command-line optimizer. It correctly called the backtrader_runner.py script for every trial, received real Sharpe Ratio values, and completed the optimization process, identifying the best parameters it could find.
DEBUGGING COMPLETE: All underlying bugs have been solved. This includes:
Script pathing issues (exit status 2, ModuleNotFoundError).
Data file pathing issues (FileNotFoundError).
Data formatting errors inside the CSV (ValueError: 'Date' is not in list).
Data type errors inside Backtrader (TypeError: must be real number, not str).
Output stream pollution that broke the optimizer (JSONDecodeError).
CONCLUSION: The core engine is stable, robust, and ready for agent integration. The "factory's" tools are all sharpened and working.
2. The Core Architecture:
We have a bayesian_runner.py script that acts as our optimization engine.
It correctly controls the backtrader_runner.py script, which now has robust data loading and sanitization logic.
Communication between the two scripts is clean and reliable.
3. My Immediate Next Steps (Your Task):
My immediate next task is to take this fully-functional, command-line-verified optimization toolchain and integrate it into the agent-based workflow.
I will be updating the OrchestratorAgent to add the new "Optimization" stage that we designed.
4. Our Next Functional Milestone: Full Automation
Our next major goal is to run the entire automated workflow from main_autogen.py: Data -> Code & Schema -> Review -> Initial Backtest -> Optimization -> Final Report.
This will involve:
Upgrading the OrchestratorAgent's prompt for the CodeAgent to include min and max bounds in the schema.
Adding the logic to the OrchestratorAgent to task the BAY_Agent after a successful backtest.
Ensuring the BAY_Agent correctly uses its tool to call the now-proven bayesian_runner.py.
5. Your Task When I Return:
When I return and provide this prompt, your task is to confirm you understand this exact state of toolchain success. Be ready to help me implement the final OrchestratorAgent logic to automate the optimization stage.
