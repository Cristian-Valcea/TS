Great—before building out these agents end-to-end, I need to nail down a few specifics. I’ll keep asking until I’m about 95% confident:

Data Provisioning
a. Which tickers (or universe) do you want to support? Single symbol or many?
b. Exact bar size(s) (5 min, 1 min, multi-scale)?
c. Regular Trading Hours only, or include pre-/post-market?
d. Any special events to prioritize (earnings, macro releases)?

RL Framework & Environment
a. Which library do you prefer for DQN? (e.g. stable-baselines3, RLlib, custom PyTorch)
b. How should we define the Gym-style environment?

Observation space (raw OHLCV, technical features?)

Action space (Buy/Hold/Sell discrete)?

Reward function (PnL per bar? Sharpe? custom)?
c. Warm-up logic for indicator initialization (how many bars)?

Training & Testing Code Generator
a. Do you want a script or Jupyter notebook template?
b. Hyperparameters to expose (learning rate, epsilon schedule, batch size, etc.)?
c. Where should models be saved/loaded (file paths, naming)?

Backtesting Agent
a. Should backtests use the same Gym env or Backtrader?
b. Key metrics to report (Sharpe, drawdown, win-rate)?
c. Plotting/visualization requirements?

Live-Trading Code Generator
a. What integration library for IBKR? (ib_insync, native API, etc.)
b. Execution logic: send market orders vs. limit?
c. Risk checks (max position size, daily loss limit)?

Trader Agent
a. Connection details: TWS vs. IB Gateway, host/port, account.
b. Frequency of inference (every bar, event-driven, …).
c. Logging/monitoring (alerts, dashboards)?

Could you please clarify these points? Feel free to answer in any order or add anything I’ve missed.
