Here is the perfect "bootstrap" recap for you to use tomorrow morning. Just copy and paste this, and we can pick up exactly where we are right now.
Project Handoff & Recap: Multi-Agent Trading System
1. Current Status (as of end-of-day 2025-06-09):
System Architecture: We have a fully implemented, file-based, asynchronous multi-agent system using a modern version of autogen-agentchat.
Component Status:
All individual agents (DataProvisioningAgent, CodeAgent, BacktesterAgent, etc.) are correctly defined with their specific tools and system messages.
All library versioning issues (initiate_chat, FunctionTool, Agent imports) have been resolved.
The core back-end utility, backtrader_runner.py, has been successfully debugged and tested standalone. It can now correctly load the data files produced by the DataProvisioningAgent.
2. Last Key Diagnostic / The "Aha!" Moment:
We ran the system with the Selector using a local Ollama model (llama3:8b) to avoid Gemini's rate limits.
We successfully diagnosed a logic failure from the log file: The llama3:8b model, while fast, was not smart enough to correctly interpret the conversation flow. It made incorrect agent selections (e.g., calling BacktesterAgent first, then UserProxy), which caused the system to halt and wait for human input.
Conclusion: We need the advanced reasoning of a model like Gemini for the crucial task of selecting the next agent, but we must respect its API rate limits.
3. The Agreed-Upon Solution (The "Delayed Smart Selector"):
We will switch the Selector back to using Gemini for its superior reasoning capabilities.
To solve the RateLimitError permanently, we will introduce a custom DelayedSelectorGroupChat class directly within main_autogen.py. This class inherits from the standard SelectorGroupChat but adds a 5-second asyncio.sleep() delay before each agent selection, ensuring we stay under the 15 requests/minute free-tier limit.
4. Next Concrete Action:
You have the complete, final code for main_autogen.py from our last message. This new code includes the DelayedSelectorGroupChat class.
Your task for tomorrow morning is to:
Open config.py and ensure the Selector agent's configuration is set back to type: "gemini".
Replace the entire contents of your current main_autogen.py with the new version I provided.
Run the system with the command: python main_autogen.py.
We are poised for a complete, successful end-to-end run. Have a great evening, and I'll be ready to analyze the results with you tomorrow
