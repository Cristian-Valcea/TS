Subject: Continuing Multi-Agent Trading System using autogen-agentchat==0.6.1
Hello, we are continuing the development of a multi-agent financial trading system. Here is the current status and context:
1. Current Architecture & Goal:
We have a multi-agent system built with a modern, asynchronous, stream-based version of autogen-agentchat.
The architecture is file-based: agents do not pass code or data in messages. Instead, they save artifacts to a shared_work_dir and announce the file paths.
The primary workflow is: User Request -> DataProvisioningAgent (saves data CSV) -> CodeAgent (saves strategy .py file) -> BacktesterAgent (runs the strategy with the data) -> TradingAgent (gives final approval).
The conversation is orchestrated by a SelectorGroupChat which acts as the selector, choosing the next agent to speak based on an LLM call.
2. Key Components & Files:
main_autogen.py: The main orchestration script. It is async, uses team.run_stream(task=...) to start, and Console to display output.
config.py: Centralizes all configuration, including LLM client mapping for each agent (AGENT_LLM_MAPPINGS) and shared file paths (SHARED_WORK_DIR, DATA_DIR, STRATEGIES_DIR).
Agent Files (agents/*.py):
data_provisioning_agent.py: An AssistantAgent with a tool to download financial data and save it to DATA_DIR.
code_agent.py: An AssistantAgent with a tool to write Python code and save it to STRATEGIES_DIR.
backtester_agent.py: An AssistantAgent with a tool that uses our custom backtrader_runner.py to execute backtests using file paths.
trading_agent.py: A simpler Agent that gives a final verdict.
user_proxy_agent.py: A modern CompatibleUserProxyAgent that participates in the chat.
Backbone Utility (common_logic/backtesting_services/backtrader_runner.py): A robust, standalone script for running Backtrader backtests. This is the "engine" our BacktesterAgent calls.
3. Last Known Status (as of 2025-06-09):
SUCCESS: All agents initialize correctly with their respective LLM clients (Gemini for tool-users, Ollama for others). All ModuleNotFoundError, TypeError, and AttributeError issues related to library versions and API changes have been resolved.
SUCCESS: The system runs! The main_autogen.py script successfully starts the SelectorGroupChat, and the conversation begins. We have confirmed agent-to-agent communication is happening.
BLOCKER: The last run ended with an openai.RateLimitError (Error code 429) from the Google Gemini API. The free tier limit of 15 requests/minute was exceeded. This is a "problem of success," indicating the system is working but too rapidly.
4. Next Steps / Current Task:
The immediate goal is to resolve the RateLimitError without upgrading to a paid plan.
Primary Strategy: Modify config.py to switch the high-frequency Selector from the rate-limited Gemini API to a local Ollama model (e.g., llama3:8b) to reduce API calls. The tool-using agents (DataProvisioningAgent, CodeAgent, BacktesterAgent) will remain on Gemini.
Secondary Strategy: Analyze the full trace log from the last run to understand the conversation flow and identify any unexpected agent behavior (e.g., loops, unnecessary tool calls).
Tertiary Strategy: For debugging, simplify the workflow by reducing the number of active agents and the complexity of the initial task.
To continue, I will provide the full log file (trace.log, ~284KB) from the last run and the key source files.
What Files to Upload/Provide in the New Prompt
If you start a new session, here are the files you should provide to give me the complete picture instantly. You don't need to upload them all at once, but having them ready is key.
Absolutely Essential (The "Core Four"):
main_autogen.py: The conductor of the orchestra.
config.py: The brain and memory of the system's configuration.
agents/backtester_agent.py: One of the most complex agents, shows how tools and utilities are integrated.
common_logic/backtesting_services/backtrader_runner.py: The core "doing" part of the system.
Highly Recommended (The Full Team):
5. agents/data_provisioning_agent.py
6. agents/code_agent.py
7. agents/user_proxy_agent.py (if you've made significant changes to it)
8. agents/trading_agent.py
The Most Important Piece of Data:
9. The full trace log file from the run that produced the RateLimitError. This is the most valuable piece of information for debugging the agent conversation flow.
